SETUP INSTRUCTIONS - E-Commerce Platform with AI-Generative Features
=====================================================================

PREREQUISITES:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

STEP 1: CLONE AND SETUP ENVIRONMENT
===================================
git clone <Repository-url>
cd E-Commerce-con-IA-Generativa

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
env\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

STEP 2: DATABASE SETUP
======================
# Apply migrations (creates database tables and default categories automatically)
python manage.py migrate

NOTE: No need to run makemigrations - migrations are already created.
The migrate command will automatically create:
- All database tables
- Default product categories (Electrónica, Ropa, Hogar, etc.)
- Review system tables

STEP 3: CREATE TEST USERS (REQUIRED FOR TESTING)
=================================================
You need 2 users to test all features:

USER 1 (SELLER):
- Go to: http://localhost:8000/register/
- Create account: seller_user / password123
- This user will create products

USER 2 (BUYER/REVIEWER):
- Go to: http://localhost:8000/register/
- Create account: buyer_user / password123
- This user will review products

STEP 4: RUN DEVELOPMENT SERVER
===============================
python manage.py runserver

STEP 5: ACCESS THE PLATFORM
============================
- Main Site: http://localhost:8000
- Admin Panel: http://localhost:8000/admin

STEP 6: TEST THE FEATURES
==========================
1. Login as seller_user → Create a product (status: "Published")
2. Logout → Login as buyer_user → Go to product detail → Leave a review
3. Check AI features at /api/ai/ (health check and product analysis)

CONFIGURATION FILES:
====================
- No configuration files need to be modified
- Database: SQLite (default, no setup required)
- AI Provider: Gemma (default, configurable via settings.AI_PROVIDER)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================
If categories don't appear:
python manage.py migrate

If you need to reset everything:
python manage.py flush
python manage.py migrate

- Admin panel access

ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS IMPLEMENTED:
==================================
- Dependency Inversion (AI providers)
- Strategy + Factory (AI client selection)
- Class-Based Views (CRUD operations)
- Custom QuerySet/Manager (product filtering)
- Observer (Django Signals for review averages)
- Strategy (review moderation)
