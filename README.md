# E-Commerce Platform with AI-Generative Features (test)

## Description
This project is an **AI-powered e-commerce platform** built with Django that revolutionizes how sellers create product listings. Instead of manually writing descriptions and labels, sellers can simply upload a product photo, and our AI system will automatically:

- **Generate detailed product descriptions** automatically
- **Suggest relevant product labels and tags** 
- **Identify product categories** based on visual content
- **Automate tedious listing creation** to save sellers hours of work

The platform provides a complete MVP with user authentication, AI-powered product management, and intelligent search capabilities.

## Project Status
**Currently in active development** with a **fully functional MVP** that includes:
- Complete user authentication system
- Product CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Image upload and management
- Product search and filtering
- Category-based organization
- Admin interface for content management
- **AI Integration in Progress**: Computer vision and description generation

## Current Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Django 5.2.4 (Python web framework)
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production ready)
- **Image Processing**: Pillow 11.3.0
- **AI/ML**: Computer vision and natural language processing (in development)

## Architecture: Dependency Inversion (Actividad 3)

We applied the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) in the `AI_API` module to decouple business logic from the concrete AI provider.

- Port defined: `AIGenerationClient` in `AI_API/ports.py` (PEP 544 `Protocol`).
- Application service `ProductAIService` now depends on the port and accepts DI through its constructor. It defaults to `Gemma3Service` adapter to preserve backwards compatibility.
- Views (`AI_API/views.py`) call `ProductAIService`, no longer importing the concrete adapter directly.

Benefits
- Replace the AI engine without changing business rules.
- Easier testing by injecting fakes/mocks.
- Infrastructure details (endpoints, headers, timeouts) isolated from application layer.

Key entry points
- Port: `AI_API/ports.py`
- Adapter: `AI_API/services.py` (`Gemma3Service`)
- Application service: `AI_API/services.py` (`ProductAIService`)
- Wiring: `AI_API/views.py`

Example: injecting a fake client for tests
```python
from AI_API.services import ProductAIService

class FakeAIClient:
    def generate_response(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return {
            "success": True,
            "response": '{"title": "Demo", "description": "...", "suggested_category": "Hogar", "tags": "a,b,c", "price_suggestion": "10"}',
            "processing_time": 0.01,
        }

    def health_check(self):
        return {"status": "healthy"}

service = ProductAIService(ai_client=FakeAIClient())
